# Homebrew Cask for ac3gui, ac3forge's Qt6 GUI front end.
#
# A Cask, not a Formula, is the right shape here: ac3gui ships as a prebuilt
# .app bundle inside each release's DragNDrop .dmg (cmake/Packaging.cmake),
# not as something a user builds from source - the same reasoning
# Formula/ac3forge.rb's own header comment and packaging/homebrew/README.md
# already gave for deferring this file. Formula/ac3forge.rb stays the
# CLI-only, build-from-source package (AC3FORGE_BUILD_CLI=ON); this Cask is
# the GUI-only, prebuilt-binary package - two independent installs, matching
# Homebrew's own Formula-vs-Cask split (build-from-source end-user tool vs.
# bundled .app), not a replacement for the Formula.
#
# Staged here (packaging/homebrew/Casks/ac3gui.rb), the same way the Formula
# was, for validation against a real release, and copied into the live
# personal tap (iainchesworthlabs/homebrew-ac3forge) as Casks/ac3gui.rb after
# each bump - see packaging/homebrew/README.md.
#
# v0.8.0-beta.2 was the first tagged release whose macos-llvm leg builds
# AC3FORGE_BUILD_GUI=ON (see docs/platforms/macos.md#gui-on-macos), so it was
# the first release whose ac3forge-*-Darwin.dmg actually contained
# ac3gui.app. **Every release tag** needs the same follow-up update "Every
# release tag" in docs/releasing.md#homebrew-formula-and-cask already
# documents for the sibling Formula: bump version, recompute sha256 from
# that release's own ac3forge-*-Darwin.dmg, validate locally, then copy into
# the tap.
#
# DR8: the .dmg this Cask installs is universal (arm64 + x86_64) as of the
# release that added .github/workflows/_build.yml's package-macos-universal
# job - arm64-macos-llvm was the only vcpkg triplet macOS CI built against
# before that; x64-macos-llvm is now its sibling, built for real on GitHub's
# macos-15-intel runner (native Intel hardware, not Rosetta) and lipo-merged
# with the arm64 build's own install tree rather than either one shipping
# alone. No `depends_on arch:` line any more for exactly that reason - the
# same .dmg installs on both architectures.

  caveats <<~EOS
    ac3gui is not Apple-notarized or code-signed. release.yml
    (.github/workflows/release.yml) signs release artifacts with GPG (a detached
    .asc) and attests build provenance via Sigstore/OIDC - neither is Apple code
    signing. macOS Gatekeeper will very likely refuse to open the app on first
    launch ("cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified") until you
    right-click ac3gui.app in Finder and choose Open, or run:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/ac3gui.app"
    This Cask itself is unverified on real hardware, same as every other macOS
    claim in this project - see docs/platforms/macos.md, which documents each one
    as CI-only until someone with a Mac checks it by hand.
